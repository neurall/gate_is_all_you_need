basic idea spawned in my head when I watched recent descovery by blue brain folks? that some real biological dendrites fire to axon only when two simultaneous inputs to them fire. i.e the kinda work like logic gate.
So I started this repo hoping to create simple nn  but with logic hates behind weights. Also wanna test spiking networks since I feel frequencies play important role in nn inputs. I.e recently nerf needed to reintroduce sinuses to input to be actually able to learn and converge. transformers needed to introduce sinuses as positional encoding also. so why not work with frequencies as first class cityzens in a first place. after all evolution is not dumb if spiking survived there must be reason for it. with frequencies you get all the weird and wonderful world of standin reflected absorbed negated waves.
and gradients ans wawes are basic building block in 3d biological topology for a reason. ie thats how any living 3d organ is shaped from lowest molecule = 3d gradients and waves. all that is not present if we use just dumb vloats as control freaks
